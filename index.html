                  $145 Billion. In March 2019, this was Venezuela's external debt due to direct government borrowing and loans made to the state-owned oil company. 
                  A beautiful country that was once a rich, oil superpower now has the most inflated currency in the world. A beautiful country that I call home. 
                  Over 12 years ago my parents made the sacrifice to move away from our family and start a new life in the United States. The 9-year-old aboard the Caracas flight to Houston would not have imagined the life I have today. 
                  Since then I have been blessed with a great public school system with fantastic teachers from elementary school to high school enabling me to learn English and succeed academically where I could. 
                  Most importantly, I have been blessed by growing up in a city as diverse as Houston, Texas. Being surrounded by kids of many different cultures and backgrounds always made me feel welcome wherever I went and taught me the importance of learning different perspectives within the world in which we live. 
                  Filled with joy, I thank my parents for the sacrifice they have made for my family. Because of them, I strive to benefit and take advantage of the many opportunities that the US has to offer.

                  At Texas A&M, I am a 4th year Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science student with a certificate in Holistic Leadership in Engineering. 

                  My professional experiences and skills have grown from my passion to connect with people and adapt to new environments. These experiences range from a variety of industries, leadership organizations, and community service. 
                  
                  Outside the classroom, the learning continues. You can find me playing saxophone in the TAMU Jazz Ensemble, or working on a personal programming project.
                  
                  Beyond Texas A&M, I plan to carry my knowledge into the industry, continue learning, continue connecting with more people, and continue solving problems. And for this, I am very grateful.

                  Following graduation I will be working as a Software Engineer at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in the New York City Metro area. In this role I will be a part of the Personalization and Insights Team (P&I) in their Digital Techonology branch. 
                  The Digital team is dedicated to creating innovative, industry-leading products and experiences that help customers access, share and control their financial data so they can make smart decisions with their money. 
                  Teams enable innovation while adhering to the firm's data sharing principles of security, customer control and convenience, and privacy.

              <h4>My Philosophy</h4>
              <p><em>Great leaders use a variety of tools to maximize their impact as leaders. 
                Developing a leadership philosophy can be a helpful practice for establishing a leadership framework. 
                Leadership philosophies often vary depending on the leader's goals and overall approach to leadership. 
                My leadership values are a result of my life experiences and have shaped the way I influence and lead others. 
                As an immigrant, because I have encountered the unknown, I value belonging. I respect leadership from different perspectives and ways of knowing. 
                Because I believe in strength in numbers, I value collaboration. I will lead with empathy, listen attentively, seek to understand, and leverage the experience and talents of others fully. 
                Because I have known good individuals, I value compassion. I listen with respect and gratitude to others. 
                My ultimate goal as a leader is to leave a legacy of community, belonging, and learning.</em></p>

              <p>
              The Texas A&M Zachry Leadership Program is a five semester-long experience sponsored by Zachry Group.
              In this organization, we explored business concepts, holistic development, and interpersonal awareness.
              What makes this program unique is that each semester we explored a topic including self awareness, empathy, creativity, purpose, and wisdom.
              This organization was indispensable to my college experience and changed what I expect from myself, how I interact with others, and how I view the world.

              <p>
              The Texas A&M Student Engineers' Council is a student organization which aims to
              provide a representative voice for the  student body, raise awareness through its service and events,
              and further the professional development of all engineering students across campus.

              In this organization, I had the opportunity to serve as a Society & Graduate Relations Co-Chair 
              where I served in a 26-member Executive Council as a liason between the SEC and over 50 engineering societies.
              As someone who is passionate about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), I spearheaded for our council to host our first 
              DEI event called WIRED (When Inclusivity Really Enhances Diversity). From this experience, I learned what it means to have a platform and what it means to have your voice heard.
